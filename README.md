# Apache-Arrow-Tutorial

This repository provides a series of Apache Arrow examples taken from various locations. The examples aim to improve understanding of what Apache Arrow is and how InfluxDB leverages this technology.

## What is Apache Arrow?

Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable big data systems to process and transfer data quickly. Arrowâ€™s main feature is its columnar in-memory data format, which is optimized for modern CPUs. This allows for efficient reading and writing of data, thereby accelerating analytics and machine learning workloads.

## What is Arrow Flight?

Arrow Flight is a framework for high performance data services built on top of Apache Arrow. It allows for the fast transfer of large datasets over network interfaces, reducing serialization overhead typically encountered with other data exchange protocols. This means you can move large datasets between applications and services with minimal latency, allowing for more real-time analytics capabilities.

## What is Apache Parquet?

Apache Parquet is a columnar storage file format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk. Parquet is optimized to work with complex data in bulk and allows for efficient storage and decoding. It is especially good when querying data with SQL-like query languages, making it a perfect fit for big data processing.
